# Journey
Journey is a learning experience running on [.NET Interactive Notebooks](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) where teachers can design a challenge-by-challenge path for students. To create a student's journey, a teacher will create a lesson in which they create challenges, provide customized feedback, and define rules to continue.

## About Journey
We model learning as a journey: personalized, interactive, and engaging. Powered by .NET Interactive notebooks, Journey empowers teachers to create learning journeys for their classroom.
Currently, Journey supports the following features:
- One-step-at-a-time learning experience (i.e. challenges are revealed incrementally)
- Rich answer evaluation
- Customizable feedback
- Open-ended learning progression
